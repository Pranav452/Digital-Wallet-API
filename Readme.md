here we have build a  backend application using FastAPI that functions as a digital wallet system. It should allow users to manage their wallets, maintain transaction records, and simulate money transfers between users. Note: This is only a backend simulation; no real money will be transferred.

to start activate venv
then run:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
then run:
python3 main.py as i have not setup the app to run via the fastapi cli command 
u may view all the routes in /docs
and u may view ur db contents locally which was made using sqlite
